    * testNLHTree3.py succeeded even though two file names (data11      * DONE
        and data12) were missing; FIX THIS (that is, make sure that     * DONE
        it fails if the NLHTree is ill-formed)                          * DONE
        - 2016-03-31 could not find any error                           * YEP

    * move __SPACES__ and getSpaces() to xlattice/crypto to avoid       * DONE
        import loops                                                    * DONE

    * search for \r\n, CRLF sequences; certainly in NLHTree code        * DONE

    * BUG: typo in curTree setter path.strip('/') should be SPLIT       * FIXED
    * rest of code in that function is ropey and obviously never        * ???
        tested                                                          * ??? 
        - need to be able to insert path (string containing forward
            slashes

    * G: add sample serialization                                       * DONE
    * G: add explicit link to MerkleTree project                        * DONE
    * G: add a link to MagicSack, which uses NLHTrees

    * find() for NLHTree should accept a glob and return a value
        - just top-level leaf nodes OK for now
        - should eventually support glob/path as an argument 
            like 'a/b/*'
    * insert should also support path
        - if force option is True
            * should create any necessary subtrees 
            * should overwrite hash if leaf node
        
2015-05-21
    * testNLHTree2.py hacked from testMerkleTree.py, needs to
        be reviewed
    * testNLHTree.py: extend doTestInsert4Leafs to choose a 
        leaf at random, delete it, and then verify that it's
        gone and the list is as expected
