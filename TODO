2017-02-08
    * need test of iterator(s) over xl_testData
    * save_to_u_dir loses the hashtype parameter, using the tree's      * DONE
        hashtype instead.                                               * DONE
    * save_to_u_dir needs to be tested
    * since uDir may not exist, save_to_u_dir() needs to be able 
        to supply all parameters to UDir.discover(), so needs optional
        dir_struc and mode parameters

2017-02-04
    * NLHTree.save_to_u_dir acquires a -I/--using_indir option
    * save_to_u_dir only writes if file is not already present in UDir
        at u_path
    * if using_indir we write to DIR_FLAT UDir at U_PATH/in/USER_ID
        where we get USER_ID from $HOME/.dvcz/id
    * otherwise we write to UDir at U_PATH

2016-11-04
    * add sections on utilities to README.md
    * drop function synonyms                                            * DONE

2016-10-21
    * nlhtree/__init__.py functions need docstring

2016-09-12
    * get rid of noisy DEBUG statements                                 * DONE

2016-09-07
    * NLHTree.insert params must include relPath; otherwise don't know
        where to put the node in the tree
    * NLHTree.clone() relies upon insert without relPath, so just
        won't work in its current form
    * dropFromU() needs further thought: there can be more than more 
        than one leaf with the same hash, and removing one such leaf 
        from the tree should not necessarily remove the corresponding 
        file from UDir

2016-08-18
    * need tests for NLHTree.find(glob) => list

2016-07-17
    * split off code building random-ish dataDir, uDir, NLHTree
        as a separate function
        
2016-07-16
    * testNLHBase.py contains stubs; implement them

    * add a function to remove (elements in ) an NLHTree from uDir
        - NLHTree.rmFromU(pathToUDir)
        - no effect if NLHTree is empty or or uDir is empty or 
            no members of NLHTree are in uDir
        - organization of uDir discovered at run time
        - rmFromU must be tested !

2016-06-13
    * testCrossFunctions.py fails, u undefined at L 571 in __init__py   * FIXED
    * xlattice/u touches NONE files, which therefore MUST BE R/W
        - u/__init__.py L 268 in discover()

2016-06-03
    * modify to use xlattice.u.UDir

2016-05-12
    * nlhSaveToUDir works, using NLHTree.saveToUDir in a clumsy way, 
        with saveToUDir a class method.  Possibly want to wrap this 
        around a class instance.  Possibly the tree should be 
        created in the called, nlhSaveToUDir
    * NLH serialization to U currently limited to U256; this should
        be selectable from the command line, defaulting to U256
    
    * need to determine which of the tests is writing trash into tmp/
    * get rid of isLeaf attribute                                       * DONE

2016-05-11
    * write python3 utilities that wrap the functions (                 * DONE
        checkInDataDir, checkInUDir, populateUDir, saveToUDir)          * DONE
        - nlhCheckInDataDir         NEEDS FIXING
        - nlhCheckInUDir            NEEDS FIXING
        - nlhPopulateDataDir        NEEDS FIXING
        - nlhSaveToUDir             NEEDS FIXING                        * WORKS
    * if the testing option is specified (-T), then output must 
        appear under tmp
        - add random prefix that is not already in use, so that the
            output is under tmp/PREFIX/
        - document this in the help message
        - when a test is run, the name of the test subdirectory must
            be clearly displayed, not lost in a a sea of messages

    * need populateDataDir and tests
    * need checkInDataDir  and tests 
2016-05-10
    * need tests of saveToUDir
    * need tests of checkInUDir
    
2016-05-06
    * need an iterator over the NLHTree which returns a sequence of 
        <hash, relative path> 2-tuples: BuildList.walk()
    * need a similar iterator which traverses the serialized NLHTree,
        BuildList.walkFile(pathToFile)

2016-05-02
    * add clone() functions                                             * DONE
        - and tests                                                     * DONE

2015-09-09
    * testNLHTree3.py succeeded even though two file names (data11      * DONE
        and data12) were missing; FIX THIS (that is, make sure that     * DONE
        it fails if the NLHTree is ill-formed)                          * DONE
        - 2016-03-31 could not find any error                           * YEP
       
2015-06-10
    * move __SPACES__ and getSpaces() to xlattice/crypto to avoid       * DONE
        import loops                                                    * DONE

2015-06-08
    * search for \r\n, CRLF sequences; certainly in NLHTree code        * DONE

2015-06-06
    * BUG: typo in curTree setter path.strip('/') should be SPLIT       * FIXED
    * rest of code in that function is ropey and obviously never        * ???
        tested                                                          * ??? 
        - need to be able to insert path (string containing forward
            slashes

2015-06-02
    * G: add sample serialization                                       * DONE
    * G: add explicit link to MerkleTree project                        * DONE
    * G: add a link to MagicSack, which uses NLHTrees

2015-05-31
    * find() for NLHTree should accept a glob and return a value
        - just top-level leaf nodes OK for now
        - should eventually support glob/path as an argument 
            like 'a/b/*'
    * insert should also support path
        - if force option is True
            * should create any necessary subtrees 
            * should overwrite hash if leaf node
        
2015-05-21
    * testNLHTree2.py hacked from testMerkleTree.py, needs to
        be reviewed
    * testNLHTree.py: extend doTestInsert4Leafs to choose a 
        leaf at random, delete it, and then verify that it's
        gone and the list is as expected

2015-05-20
    * working on NLHBase in __init__.py
