    * swap fields in serialization so that the name is at the
        beginning of the line

    * BUG: typo in curTree setter path.strip('/') should be SPLIT       * FIXED
    * rest of code in that function is ropey and obviously never
        tested 
        - need to be able to insert path (string containing forward
            slashes

    * G: add sample serialization 
    * G: add explicit link to MerkleTree project
    * G: add a link to MagicSack, which uses NLHTrees

    * find() for NLHTree should accept a glob and return a value
        - just top-level leaf nodes OK for now
        - should eventually support glob/path as an argument 
            like 'a/b/*'
    * insert should also support path
        - if force option is True
            * should create any necessary subtrees 
            * should overwrite hash if leaf node

    * testNLHTree2.py hacked from testMerkleTree.py, needs to
        be reviewed
    * testNLHTree.py: extend doTestInsert4Leafs to choose a 
        leaf at random, delete it, and then verify that it's
        gone and the list is as expected
