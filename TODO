    * nlhSaveToUDir works, using NLHTree.saveToUDir in a clumsy way, 
        with saveToUDir a class method.  Possibly want to wrap this 
        around a class instance.  Possibly the tree should be 
        created in the called, nlhSaveToUDir
    * NLH serialization to U currently limited to U256; this should
        be selectable from the command line, defaulting to U256
    
    * need to determine which of the tests is writing trash into tmp/

2016-05-11
    * write python3 utilities that wrap the functions (
        checkInDataDir, checkInUDir, populateUDir, saveToUDir)
        - nlhCheckInDataDir         NEEDS FIXING
        - nlhCheckInUDir            NEEDS FIXING
        - nlhPopulateDataDir        NEEDS FIXING
        - nlhSaveToUDir             NEEDS FIXING                        * WORKS
    * if the testing option is specified (-T), then output must 
        appear under tmp
        - add random prefix that is not already in use, so that the
            output is under tmp/PREFIX/
        - document this in the help message
        - when a test is run, the name of the test subdirectory must
            be clearly displayed, not lost in a a sea of messages

    * need populateDataDir and tests
    * need checkInDataDir  and tests 
2016-05-10
    * need tests of saveToUDir
    * need tests of checkInUDir

    * need an iterator over the NLHTree which returns a sequence of 
        <hash, relative path> 2-tuples: BuildList.walk()
    * need a similar iterator which traverses the serialized NLHTree,
        BuildList.walkFile(pathToFile)

2016-05-02
    * add clone() functions                                             * DONE
        - and tests                                                     * DONE

2015-09-09
    * testNLHTree3.py succeeded even though two file names (data11      * DONE
        and data12) were missing; FIX THIS (that is, make sure that     * DONE
        it fails if the NLHTree is ill-formed)                          * DONE
        - 2016-03-31 could not find any error                           * YEP
       
2015-06-10
    * move __SPACES__ and getSpaces() to xlattice/crypto to avoid       * DONE
        import loops                                                    * DONE

2015-06-08
    * search for \r\n, CRLF sequences; certainly in NLHTree code        * DONE

2015-06-06
    * BUG: typo in curTree setter path.strip('/') should be SPLIT       * FIXED
    * rest of code in that function is ropey and obviously never        * ???
        tested                                                          * ??? 
        - need to be able to insert path (string containing forward
            slashes

2015-06-02
    * G: add sample serialization                                       * DONE
    * G: add explicit link to MerkleTree project                        * DONE
    * G: add a link to MagicSack, which uses NLHTrees

2015-05-31
    * find() for NLHTree should accept a glob and return a value
        - just top-level leaf nodes OK for now
        - should eventually support glob/path as an argument 
            like 'a/b/*'
    * insert should also support path
        - if force option is True
            * should create any necessary subtrees 
            * should overwrite hash if leaf node
        
2015-05-21
    * testNLHTree2.py hacked from testMerkleTree.py, needs to
        be reviewed
    * testNLHTree.py: extend doTestInsert4Leafs to choose a 
        leaf at random, delete it, and then verify that it's
        gone and the list is as expected

    * working on NLHBase in __init__.py
